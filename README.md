# React 

TI had the pleasure of being the product owner for Caption-This, a fun project I worked on with two colleagues during a bootcamp. Our goal was to build a game where users could add captions to random memes. We successfully completed the MVP within a 24-hour timeframe and it was a great experience working on something light-hearted and enjoyable.

While we were able to achieve our initial goals, we had some exciting ideas for expanding the app's features. In the future, I plan to refine the user interface and create a voting system for users to compete for the funniest caption. I also want to enable users to add their own memes and import external APIs to provide more random images for captioning.
